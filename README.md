# Logistic Regression from Scratch with a Neural Network Approach

## Project Overview
This project implements **Logistic Regression** from scratch, mimicking a simple neural network approach. It includes:
- Model initialization
- Forward propagation using the sigmoid activation function
- Log loss calculation
- Gradient computation for weights and bias
- Gradient descent optimization
- Accuracy evaluation

The dataset used is a synthetic binary classification dataset generated using `make_blobs` from the `sklearn` library.

## Prerequisites
You need the following Python libraries to run the project:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Running the Project
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the main script to train the logistic regression model:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
3. The script will output the model's accuracy and display the loss curve over the training iterations.

## Output
- **Accuracy**: The final accuracy of the model on the synthetic data.
- **Loss Curve**: A plot showing how the loss decreases over the iterations of gradient descent.

## Acknowledgments
Inspired by logistic regression and neural network concepts from standard machine learning tutorials.
